"5. Effective February 2018, LMIAs in support of Permanent Residence (PR) are excluded from TFWP statistics reporting, unless reported separately. This may impact statistics reported over time.",,,,,
"6. The LMIA System tracks TFW positions only, not TFWs who are issued a work permit or who enter Canada. Not all positions approved result in a work permit or a TFW entering Canada. For information on the number of work permits issued, please consult Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada's (IRCC) Facts and Figures: http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/statistics/menu-fact.asp",,,,,
