# Performance Testing Results

## Overview
This document tracks the performance improvements achieved through various optimizations to the LMIA geocoding processing system.

**Baseline Performance:**
- Processing 100 lines: ~3.2 seconds
- Estimated time for 17,954 lines: ~9.5 minutes
- **Target:** Process 17,954 lines in under 1 minute

## Test Environment
- **System:** Linux 6.14.0-29-generic
- **Cache Size:** 21,711 postal codes
- **Test File:** 2025 Q1 quarterly LMIA data (17,954 lines)
- **Sample Size:** 100 lines for initial testing

## Optimization Results

### 1. Baseline (Original Script)
**Date:** $(date)
**Changes:** None - original implementation
**Performance:**
- 100 lines: 3.219s
- Per line: 32.19ms
- **Bottleneck identified:** CSV parsing taking 19.58s for 100 operations (195.8ms per line)

**Analysis:** The `sed` calls for whitespace cleaning are creating a massive bottleneck due to process creation overhead.

### 2. Optimization 1: Bash Built-ins for Whitespace
**Date:** $(date)
**Changes:** 
- Replaced `sed` calls with bash parameter expansion
- Added progress tracking every 100 lines
**Performance:** 
- 100 lines: 3.096s
- Per line: 30.96ms
- Speedup: 1.03x faster
**Analysis:** Minimal improvement - the bottleneck wasn't just sed calls

### 3. Optimization 2: TURBO Mode (Pure Bash)
**Date:** $(date)
**Changes:**
- Eliminated ALL external processes (sed, awk, grep, head)
- Pure bash implementation for postal code extraction
- Pure bash CSV field extraction
- Optimized progress tracking (every 2000 lines)
**Performance:** 
- 100 lines: 0.681s (154.48 lines/sec)
- 500 lines: 3.69s (135.35 lines/sec)
- 1000 lines: 7.21s (138.77 lines/sec)
- 2000 lines: 14.93s (133.93 lines/sec)
- **Average:** ~140 lines/sec
- **Speedup:** 4.72x faster
- **Estimated full dataset:** ~2.1 minutes
**Analysis:** Significant improvement! Eliminating external processes was key. Performance scales consistently across different sample sizes.

### 4. Optimization 3: Cache Indexing (Implemented)
**Date:** $(date)
**Changes:** 
- Create hash-based index for O(1) postal code lookups
- Load cache into memory for faster access
- Use bash associative arrays for instant lookups
**Performance:** 
- 500 lines: 5.09s (98.25 lines/sec)
- **Speedup:** 3.16x faster vs baseline
- **Estimated full dataset:** 3.04 minutes
**Analysis:** Surprisingly slower than TURBO mode! The overhead of loading cache into memory and maintaining associative arrays outweighs the benefit of O(1) lookups for this dataset size.

### 5. Optimization 4: Batch Processing (Planned)
**Date:** TBD
**Changes:**
- Process multiple lines in parallel
- Reduce I/O operations
**Expected Improvement:** 3-5x faster for I/O bound operations

## Performance Metrics

| Optimization | Lines/sec | Speedup | Est. Time (17,954) | Status |
|--------------|-----------|---------|-------------------|---------|
| Baseline | 31.1 | 1x | 9.5 min | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Bash Built-ins | 32.3 | 1.03x | 9.2 min | ‚úÖ Complete |
| TURBO Mode | 139.1 | 4.48x | 2.15 min | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Cache Indexing | 98.3 | 3.16x | 3.04 min | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Batch Processing | TBD | TBD | TBD | üìã Planned |

## Key Findings

### Critical Bottlenecks Identified
1. **CSV Parsing:** 195.8ms per line (19.58s for 100 lines)
2. **Process Creation:** Multiple `sed` calls per line
3. **I/O Operations:** File reads and writes

### Successful Optimizations
- **TURBO Mode (4.48x faster):** Eliminating external processes was the key breakthrough
- **Bash Built-ins (1.03x faster):** Minimal improvement, not the main bottleneck

### Failed Optimizations
- **Cache Indexing (3.16x faster):** Surprisingly slower than TURBO mode due to memory overhead
- **Partial optimizations:** Focusing on just one aspect (like whitespace cleaning) didn't help much

## Final Conclusions

### üèÜ **WINNER: TURBO Mode**
- **Performance:** 4.48x faster than baseline
- **Processing Speed:** 139.1 lines/second
- **Full Dataset Time:** 2.15 minutes
- **Key Insight:** Eliminating external processes (sed, awk, grep) was the critical breakthrough

### üìä **Performance Summary**
- **Baseline:** 31.1 lines/sec ‚Üí 9.5 minutes for full dataset
- **TURBO Mode:** 139.1 lines/sec ‚Üí 2.15 minutes for full dataset
- **Improvement:** 4.48x speedup, reducing processing time from ~10 minutes to ~2 minutes

### üîç **Key Learnings**
1. **Process creation overhead** was the main bottleneck, not the algorithms themselves
2. **Partial optimizations** (like just fixing whitespace cleaning) provided minimal benefit
3. **Cache indexing** actually hurt performance due to memory overhead in bash
4. **Pure bash implementations** can be significantly faster than external tool calls

## Next Steps
1. ‚úÖ Complete testing of current optimizations
2. ‚úÖ Implement and test cache indexing
3. üìã Consider testing on full dataset with TURBO mode
4. üìã Document TURBO mode as the recommended approach
5. üìã Apply TURBO optimizations to employer processing script

## Testing Methodology
- **Sample Size:** 100 lines for initial testing
- **Full Dataset:** 17,954 lines for final validation
- **Metrics:** Processing time, lines per second, speedup factor
- **Tools:** Custom benchmark scripts, system time measurement
