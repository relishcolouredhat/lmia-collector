**Important Note on Open Source:** All LLM-generated code in this repository is inherently open source and cannot be owned or copyrighted by any individual or organization. This is because:

1. **Training Data Origin**: The models were trained on publicly available, open source code
2. **Derivative Nature**: LLM-generated code is derived from existing open source works
3. **Legal Status**: Such code cannot establish new intellectual property rights

We maintain this repository as open source to honor the original authors' contributions and to ensure transparency in how the code was created. All code is available under the same open source license as the training data that made it possible.
