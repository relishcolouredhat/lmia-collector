"2. This list excludes all personal names, such as employers of caregivers or business names that use or include personal names. For this reason, the list is not complete and does not reflect all employers who requested or received an LMIA. Should an employer wish to contact ESDC concerning the accuracy of their information, please contact NA-TFWP-PTET@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca.",,,,,,,
"3. The employer name is manually entered in system. As such, accuracy of the names is subject to potential data entry error and inconsistent spelling.",,,,,,,
"4. Effective November 2016, NOC 2011 is being used. Prior to November 2016, all occupations under NOC 2006 were converted to the respective NOC 2011 occupation. Empirical concordance released by Statistics Canada was used to determine appropriate linkages.",,,,,,,
"5. Effective February 2018, LMIAs in support of 'Permanent Residence (PR) Only' are excluded from TFWP statistics, unless reported separately. Dual-intent LMIAs and corresponding positions are included under their respective TFWP stream (e.g., low-wage, high-wage, etc.) This may impact program reporting over time.",,,,,,,
"6. The LMIA System tracks TFW positions only, not TFWs who are issued a work permit or who enter Canada. Not all positions approved result in a work permit or a TFW entering Canada. For information on the number of work permits issued, please consult Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada's (IRCC) Facts and Figures: http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/statistics/menu-fact.asp",,,,,,,
